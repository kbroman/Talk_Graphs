## Talk on &ldquo;How to display data badly&rdquo;


These are slides for a talk that I give as often as possible, because
it's fun.

This was inspired by Howard Wainer's article, whose title I stole:
[H Wainer (1984) How to display data badly American Statistician
38:137-147](http://www.rci.rutgers.edu/~roos/Courses/grstat502/wainer.pdf)


A recent PDF is
[here](http://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~kbroman/presentations/IowaState2013/graphs_combined.pdf).

A whole bunch of older versions of the slides are at
[my UW&ndash;Madison webpage](http://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~kbroman/presentations/]),
including the
[Director's cut](http://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~kbroman/presentations/graphs_mac.ppt)
of
[the censored version](http://kbroman.wordpress.com/2012/11/21/the-hopkins-sph-logo-part-2/).

The [R](https://github.com/kbroman/Talk_Graphs/tree/master/R)
directory contains the R code to make the (generally nicer) figures,
plus Excel files in which the uglier figures were made.

The [Figs](https://github.com/kbroman/Talk_Graphs/tree/master/Figs)
directory contains only the Excel-based figures; the R-based figures
are not included in the respository.

There's also slides of the
&ldquo;[Top Ten Worst Graphs](http://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~kbroman/topten_worstgraphs)&rdquo;
([pdf here](http://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~kbroman/presentations/topten.pdf)).
The needed figures are not in this repository, but are available
[here](http://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~kbroman/topten_worstgraphs/TopTenWorstGraphs.zip).

I'm working on a third set of slides, &ldquo;More on data visualization,&rdquo;
with further advice on developing data visualizations. [[pdf here](http://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~kbroman/presentations/more_on_graphs.pdf)]

Also see the [combined pdf](http://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~kbroman/presentations/graphs_combined.pdf).
