## Talk on &ldquo;Creating effective figures and tables&rdquo;

These are slides for a talk that I give as often as possible, because
it's fun.

A recent PDF is
[here](https://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~kbroman/presentations/graphs2018.pdf).

A video is available [on youtube](https://youtu.be/Ssso_5X1UPs).

A whole bunch of older versions of the slides are at
[my UW&ndash;Madison webpage](https://kbroman.org/talks.html)
including the
[Director's cut](https://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~kbroman/presentations/graphs_mac.ppt)
of
[the censored version](https://kbroman.wordpress.com/2012/11/21/the-hopkins-sph-logo-part-2/).

The [R](https://github.com/kbroman/Talk_Graphs/tree/master/R)
directory contains the R code to make the (generally nicer) figures,
plus Excel files in which the uglier figures were made.

The [Figs](https://github.com/kbroman/Talk_Graphs/tree/master/Figs)
directory contains only the Excel-based figures; the R-based figures
are not included in the repository.

There are also slides of the
&ldquo;[Top Ten Worst Graphs](https://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~kbroman/topten_worstgraphs)&rdquo;
([pdf here](https://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~kbroman/presentations/topten.pdf)).
The needed figures are not in this repository, but are available
[here](https://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~kbroman/topten_worstgraphs/TopTenWorstGraphs.zip).
